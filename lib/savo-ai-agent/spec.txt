Conver get lead and conver it to a client

Then when he is client moves to ret and they try to bring more money from him

Now when this lead comes to conver they write commemts like

Age : 30

Work : doctor

Income : 10,000 month

City : johansburg

Family : wife 3 kids

Now we make a teamplate and agents fill up client info
